This application is for spliting the bill when two friends eating together. In this project, I used some React main concept such as:
1. useState and State Management
2. Derived State
3. Lifting up State
4. Key props to reset the state

The function of application are:
1. add the friends
2. select the friend who eats together
3. input the total amount of bill
4. input the amount which user wants to pay
5. calculate automatically the amount which the friend have to pay
